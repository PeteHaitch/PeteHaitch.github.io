## Experience

I have enjoyed tutoring mathematics and statistics since I was a high school 
student, with private tutoring supporting me financially during my final years 
of high school and through my undergraduate studies. I was fortunate enough to 
obtain a research assistant position to support me during my PhD studies, but 
this meant I did not have time to teach university tutorials.

I have experience planning and teaching workshops on R and Bioconductor, such 
as a 3-hour workshop on analysing DNA methylation microarrays held as part of 
the annual Bioconductor meeting in 2016. These workshops typically have 
participants from a range of backgrounds, from statisticians to wet-lab 
biologists. 

With the collaborative nature of my research, I have taken the opportunity to 
introduce data science skills to my colleagues. This typically starts with the 
basics of installing R and teaching how to import data and perform basic 
statistical and graphical summaries. Many people immediately see benefits to 
this over their current approaches as well as the potential that furthering 
these skills offers to them in simplifying and accelerating their research. 
Some colleagues have progressed to the point where they can use various 
packages to run their own analyses, generate publication-quality graphics, and 
write reproducible reports. I have also enjoyed informally introducing 
statistical colleagues to software development and helping them with techniques 
such as version control and in creating their first R package. 

## Teaching philosophy

I am interested in finding ways to develop statistical and data science skills 
for people in fields not typically exposed to these or not well-served by 
current training. Apart from the obvious general benefits of being able to 
reason with data, the ability to analyse data and clearly communicate summaries 
and results are highly valued in modern workplaces and businesses which are generating and collecting data like never before. As such, I believe that 
students would benefit from data science skills being taught more widely. Part 
of this effort is in recognising that data science has an overlapping 
yet distinct identity to statistics, which involves skills not typically taught 
in an introductory statistics class.

With my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in mathematics and statistics, I 
am capable of teaching a variety of statistics classes. I also have 
experience in teaching people with a less mathematical or computational 
background, particularly in introducing statistical computing. At a more 
advanced or specialised level, my experience makes me well-suited to teaching 
statistical computing, advanced data science, data visualisation, and 
statistical genomics.

I take inspiration from teachers such as Jenny Bryan (University of British 
Columbia), Amelia McNamara (Smith College), Jeff Leek (Johns Hopkins 
University), and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel (Duke University) in their efforts to 
modernise statistics education and to develop data science curricula at the 
undergraduate and graduate levels. 

I have found that the 'tidyverse' of R packages, developed and popularised by 
Hadley Wickham and colleagues, are well-received by new users to R due to their 
relatively consistent design. This consistency provides faster rewards to the 
user, giving them confidence to try new things and extend their abilities. 
Although more complicated due to its vast scope and number of packages, 
Bioconductor provides an excellent teaching model with its extensive use of 
package vignettes and workflows. These are wonderful resources when developing 
teaching material for classes and workshops.

I like to use real datasets when teaching, ideally tailored to the students 
interests or that are otherwise of general interest. Although it requires extra 
effort to identify these datasets, I believe it is worth it to help capture and 
retain students' interest in understanding and solving the problem. I also like 
to teach data analysis in all its dirty glory, although I appreciate that care 
needs to be taken to balance the use of 'messy' data, to teach the essential 
skills of data wrangling and tidying, with the use of 'clean' or tidy data to 
focus on illustrating key statistical concepts. 

Apart from teaching the technical and analytical skills needed to analyse data, 
I would like also to emphasise the communication skills needed to share the 
results of an analysis. One key skill for communicating your results is the 
ability to make clear and informative data visualisations and statistical 
graphics. Strong communication skills are critical to making your work count, 
especially in the workforce where you may be working in a multidisciplinary 
team or required to explain your results to management who are not necessarily 
well-trained in statistics or analytics.
