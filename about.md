## Scientific interests

For the past six years, I have applied my statistical skills in genomics research, but I am interested in all areas of statistics (fine, _Data Science_). I love working in collaboration with other people, be they biologists, medical doctors, fellow statisticians or anyone who simply has data and wants to understand what the hell is going on. A lot of my time is spent programming, mainly in R and Python.

In my PhD research, I am developing statistical methods and software for the analysis of DNA methylation from whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing datasets. I am particularly interested in understanding the spatial dependence structure of CpG methylation and how this dependence can be exploited in analyses of DNA methylation data. My PhD advisors are [Terry Speed](http://www.wehi.edu.au/faculty_members/professor_terry_speed) and [Peter Hall](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~halpstat/).

I also work as a research assistant at WEHI in the [statistical genetics group of Melanie Bahlo](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/genetics/). In this role I have performed linkage mapping and analysed genome-wide association studies to understand a variety of genetic diseases, from rare Mendelian diseases through to common complex traits. I have also analysed many whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing experiments of both humans and mice.

## Procrastinations

For kicks, I play guitar. There are a couple of videos you can check out on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrPeteHaitch/videos).
