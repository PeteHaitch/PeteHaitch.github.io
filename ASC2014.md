These links accompany my presentation, "_Simulating whole genome DNA methylation data_", which I presented at the [Australian Statistical Conference 2014](http://www.ims-asc2014.com) in Sydney, Australia on July 10 2014.

## Slides

[Here are my slides (pdf)]({{ site.url }}/presentations/ASC2014_Peter_Hickey.pdf).

## Software
* [`methsim`](http://www.github.com/PeteHaitch/methsim): An R package for simulating whole genome DNA methylation data.
* [`comethylation`](http://www.github.com/PeteHaitch/comethylation): A Python module for calling methylation patterns at m-tuples from bisulfite-sequencing data.
* [`cometh`](http://www.github.com/PeteHaitch/cometh): An R package for analysing DNA methylation data, including output of `comethylation`.

## Poster
I have also presented this work as a poster at the Epigenomics of Common Diseases meeting in Hinxton, UK in November 2013. The poster can be [viewed on Figshare](http://figshare.com/articles/Simulating_whole_genome_bisulfite_sequencing_data/834976).
