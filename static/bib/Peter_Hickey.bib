	Abstract = {Epigenetic modifications confer stable transcriptional patterns
              in the brain, and both normal and abnormal brain function involve
              specialized brain regions, yet little is known about brain
              region-specific epigenetic differences. Here, we compared
              prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus and
              nucleus accumbens from 6 individuals, performing whole genome
              bisulfite sequencing for DNA methylation. In addition, we have
              performed ATAC-seq for chromatin accessibility, and RNA-seq for
              gene expression in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex
              from 6 additional individuals. We found substantial neuron- and
              brain region-specific differences in both DNA methylation and
              chromatin accessibility which were largely non-overlapping, and
              were greatest between nucleus accumbens and the other regions. In
              contrast, glial methylation and chromatin were relatively
              homogeneous across brain regions, although neuron/glia ratios
              varied greatly, demonstrating the necessity for cellular
              fractionation. Gene expression was also largely the same across
              glia from different brain regions and substantially different for
              neurons. Expression was correlated with methylation and
              accessibility across promoters and known enhancers. Several
              classes of transcription factor binding sites were enriched at
              regions of differential methylation and accessibility, including
              many that respond to synaptic activity. Finally, both regions of
              differential methylation and those of differential accessibility
              showed a surprising >10-fold enrichment of explained heritability
              associated with addictive behavior, as well as schizophrenia- and
              neuroticism-associated regions, suggesting that common
              psychiatric illness is mediated through brain region-specific
              epigenetic marks.},

	Abstract = {AIMS: We identified a novel homozygous truncating mutation in
                 the gene encoding alpha kinase 3 (ALPK3) in a family
                 presenting with paediatric cardiomyopathy. A recent study
                 identified biallelic truncating mutations of ALPK3 in three
                 unrelated families; therefore, there is strong genetic
                 evidence that ALPK3 mutation causes cardiomyopathy. This study
                 aimed to clarify the mutation mechanism and investigate the
                 molecular and cellular pathogenesis underlying ALPK3-mediated
                 cardiomyopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed detailed
                 clinical and genetic analyses of a consanguineous family,
                 identifying a new ALPK3 mutation (c.3792G>A, p.W1264X) which
                 undergoes nonsense-mediated decay in ex vivo and in vivo
                 tissues. Ultra-structural analysis of cardiomyocytes derived
                 from patient-specific and human ESC-derived stem cell lines
                 lacking ALPK3 revealed disordered sarcomeres and intercalated
                 discs. Multi-electrode array analysis and calcium imaging
                 demonstrated an extended field potential duration and abnormal
                 calcium handling in mutant contractile cultures. CONCLUSIONS:
                 This study validates the genetic evidence, suggesting that
                 mutations in ALPK3 can cause familial cardiomyopathy and
                 demonstrates loss of function as the underlying genetic
                 mechanism. We show that ALPK3-deficient cardiomyocytes derived
                 from pluripotent stem cell models recapitulate the
                 ultrastructural and electrophysiological defects observed in
                 vivo. Analysis of differentiated contractile cultures
                 identified abnormal calcium handling as a potential feature of
                 cardiomyocytes lacking ALPK3, providing functional insights
                 into the molecular mechanisms underlying ALPK3-mediated
                 cardiomyopathy.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presence of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9)
                 methylation on the mouse inactive X chromosome has been
                 controversial over the last 15 years, and the functional role
                 of H3K9 methylation in X chromosome inactivation in any
                 species has remained largely unexplored. RESULTS: Here we
                 report the first genomic analysis of H3K9 di- and
                 tri-methylation on the inactive X: we find they are enriched
                 at the intergenic, gene poor regions of the inactive X,
                 interspersed between H3K27 tri-methylation domains found in
                 the gene dense regions. Although H3K9 methylation is
                 predominantly non-genic, we find that depletion of H3K9
                 methylation via depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase Set domain
                 bifurcated 1 (Setdb1) during the establishment of X
                 inactivation, results in failure of silencing for around 150
                 genes on the inactive X. By contrast, we find a very minor
                 role for Setdb1-mediated H3K9 methylation once X inactivation
                 is fully established. In addition to failed gene silencing, we
                 observed a specific failure to silence X-linked long-terminal
                 repeat class repetitive elements. CONCLUSIONS: Here we have
                 shown that H3K9 methylation clearly marks the murine inactive
                 X chromosome. The role of this mark is most apparent during
                 the establishment phase of gene silencing, with a more muted
                 effect on maintenance of the silent state. Based on our data,
                 we hypothesise that Setdb1-mediated H3K9 methylation plays a
                 role in epigenetic silencing of the inactive X via silencing
                 of the repeats, which itself facilitates gene silencing
                 through alterations to the conformation of the whole inactive
                 X chromosome.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phenotypic variability among inbred littermates
                 reared in controlled environments remains poorly understood.
                 Metastable epialleles refer to loci that intrinsically behave
                 in this way and a few examples have been described. They
                 display differential methylation in association with
                 differential expression. For example, inbred mice carrying the
                 agouti viable yellow (A (vy) ) allele show a range of coat
                 colours associated with different DNA methylation states at
                 the locus. The availability of next-generation sequencing, in
                 particular whole genome sequencing of bisulphite converted
                 DNA, allows us, for the first time, to search for metastable
                 epialleles at base pair resolution. RESULTS: Using whole
                 genome bisulphite sequencing of DNA from the livers of five
                 mice from the A (vy) colony, we searched for sites at which
                 DNA methylation differed among the mice. A small number of
                 loci, 356, were detected and we call these inter-individual
                 Differentially Methylated Regions, iiDMRs, 55 of which overlap
                 with endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs). Whole genome
                 resequencing of two mice from the colony identified very few
                 differences and these did not occur at or near the iiDMRs.
                 Further work suggested that the majority of ERV iiDMRs are
                 metastable epialleles; the level of methylation was maintained
                 in tissue from other germ layers and the level of mRNA from
                 the neighbouring gene inversely correlated with methylation
                 state. Most iiDMRs that were not overlapping ERV insertions
                 occurred at tissue-specific DMRs and it cannot be ruled out
                 that these are driven by changes in the ratio of cell types in
                 the tissues analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Using the most thorough
                 genome-wide profiling technologies for differentially
                 methylated regions, we find very few intrinsically
                 epigenetically variable regions that we term iiDMRs. The most
                 robust of these are at retroviral elements and appear to be
                 metastable epialleles. The non-ERV iiDMRs cannot be described
                 as metastable epialleles at this stage but provide a novel
                 class of variably methylated elements for further study.},

@article{Bahlo2010-tp,
	Abstract = {As of June 2009, 361 genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
                 had been referenced by the HuGE database. GWAS require DNA
                 from many thousands of individuals, relying on suitable DNA
                 collections. We recently performed a multiple sclerosis (MS)
                 GWAS where a substantial component of the cases (24\%) had DNA
                 derived from saliva. Genotyping was done on the Illumina
                 genotyping platform using the Infinium Hap370CNV DUO
                 microarray. Additionally, we genotyped 10 individuals in
                 duplicate using both saliva- and blood-derived DNA. The
                 performance of blood- versus saliva-derived DNA was compared
                 using genotyping call rate, which reflects both the quantity
                 and quality of genotyping per sample and the ``GCScore,'' an
                 Illumina genotyping quality score, which is a measure of DNA
                 quality. We also compared genotype calls and GCScores for the
                 10 sample pairs. Call rates were assessed for each sample
                 individually. For the GWAS samples, we compared data according
                 to source of DNA and center of origin. We observed high
                 concordance in genotyping quality and quantity between the
                 paired samples and minimal loss of quality and quantity of DNA
                 in the saliva samples in the large GWAS sample, with the blood
                 samples showing greater variation between centers of origin.
                 This large data set highlights the usefulness of saliva DNA
                 for genotyping, especially in high-density single-nucleotide
                 polymorphism microarray studies such as GWAS.},

@article{Hickey2011-tf,
	Abstract = {Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed many
                 fascinating insights into complex diseases even from simple,
                 single-marker statistical tests. Most of these tests are
                 designed for testing of associations between a phenotype and
                 an autosomal genotype and are therefore not applicable to X
                 chromosome data. Testing for association on the X chromosome
                 raises unique challenges that have motivated the development
                 of X-specific statistical tests in the literature. However, to
                 date there has been no study of these methods under a wide
                 range of realistic study designs, allele frequencies and
                 disease models to assess the size and power of each test. To
                 address this, we have performed an extensive simulation study
                 to investigate the effects of the sex ratios in the case and
                 control cohorts, as well as the allele frequencies, on the
                 size and power of eight test statistics under three different
                 disease models that each account for X-inactivation. We show
                 that existing, but under-used, methods that make use of both
                 male and female data are uniformly more powerful than popular
                 methods that make use of only female data. In particular, we
                 show that Clayton's one degree of freedom statistic [Clayton,
                 2008] is robust and powerful across a wide range of realistic
                 simulation parameters. Our results provide guidance on
                 selecting the most appropriate test statistic to analyse X
                 chromosome data from GWAS and show that much power can be
                 gained by a more careful analysis of X chromosome GWAS data.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders are a heterogeneous
                 group of disorders in which the underlying genetic defect is
                 often unknown. We have identified a pathogenic mutation
                 (c.156C>G [p.F52L]) in YARS2, located at chromosome 12p11.21,
                 by using genome-wide SNP-based homozygosity analysis of a
                 family with affected members displaying myopathy, lactic
                 acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). We subsequently
                 identified the same mutation in another unrelated MLASA
                 patient. The YARS2 gene product, mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA
                 synthetase (YARS2), was present at lower levels in skeletal
                 muscle whereas fibroblasts were relatively normal. Complex I,
                 III, and IV were dysfunctional as indicated by enzyme
                 analysis, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. A
                 mitochondrial protein-synthesis assay showed reduced levels of
                 respiratory chain subunits in myotubes generated from patient
                 cell lines. A tRNA aminoacylation assay revealed that mutant
                 YARS2 was still active; however, enzyme kinetics were abnormal
                 compared to the wild-type protein. We propose that the reduced
                 aminoacylation activity of mutant YARS2 enzyme leads to
                 decreased mitochondrial protein synthesis, resulting in
                 mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction. MLASA has
                 previously been associated with PUS1 mutations; hence, the
                 YARS2 mutation reported here is an alternative cause of MLASA.},

@article{Lacey2015-ba,
	Abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are
                 chronic inflammatory diseases that together affect 2-3\% of
                 the population. RA and AS predominantly involve joints, but
                 heart disease is also a common feature in RA and AS patients.
                 Here we have studied a new spontaneous mutation that causes
                 severe polyarthritis in bone phenotype spontaneous mutation 1
                 (BPSM1) mice. In addition to joint destruction, mutant mice
                 also develop aortic root aneurism and aorto-mitral valve
                 disease that can be fatal depending on the genetic background.
                 The cause of the disease is the spontaneous insertion of a
                 retrotransposon into the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the
                 tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which triggers its strong
                 overexpression in myeloid cells. We found that several members
                 of a family of RNA-binding, CCCH-containing zinc-finger
                 proteins control TNF expression through its 3'UTR, and we
                 identified a previously unidentified regulatory element in the
                 UTR. The disease in BPSM1 mice is independent of the adaptive
                 immune system and does not appear to involve inflammatory
                 cytokines other than TNF. To our knowledge, this is the first
                 animal model showing both polyarthritis and heart disease as a
                 direct result of TNF deregulation. These results emphasize the
                 therapeutic potential of anti-TNF drugs for the treatment of
                 heart valve disease and identify potential therapeutic targets
                 to control TNF expression and inflammation.},
