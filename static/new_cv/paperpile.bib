  abstract = "The impact of inherited genetic variation on gene expression in
              humans is well-established. The majority of known expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) impact expression of local genes
              (cis-eQTLs). More research is needed to identify effects of
              genetic variation on distant genes (trans-eQTLs) and understand
              their biological mechanisms. One common trans-eQTLs mechanism is
              ``mediation'' by a local (cis) transcript. Thus, mediation
              analysis can be applied to genome-wide SNP and expression data in
              order to identify transcripts that are ``cis-mediators'' of
              trans-eQTLs, including those ``cis-hubs'' involved in regulation
              of many trans-genes. Identifying such mediators helps us
              understand regulatory networks and suggests biological mechanisms
              underlying trans-eQTLs, both of which are relevant for
              understanding susceptibility to complex diseases. The multitissue
              expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
              program provides a unique opportunity to study cis-mediation
              across human tissue types. However, the presence of complex
              hidden confounding effects in biological systems can make
              mediation analyses challenging and prone to confounding bias,
              particularly when conducted among diverse samples. To address
              this problem, we propose a new method: Genomic Mediation analysis
              with Adaptive Confounding adjustment (GMAC). It enables the
              search of a very large pool of variables, and adaptively selects
              potential confounding variables for each mediation test. Analyses
              of simulated data and GTEx data demonstrate that the adaptive
              selection of confounders by GMAC improves the power and precision
              of mediation analysis. Application of GMAC to GTEx data provides
              new insights into the observed patterns of cis-hubs and
              trans-eQTL regulation across tissue types.",

              of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells to balance
              expression dosage between XX females and XY males. XCI is,
              however, incomplete in humans: up to one-third of X-chromosomal
              genes are expressed from both the active and inactive X
              chromosomes (Xa and Xi, respectively) in female cells, with the
              degree of 'escape' from inactivation varying between genes and
              individuals. The extent to which XCI is shared between cells and
              tissues remains poorly characterized, as does the degree to which
              incomplete XCI manifests as detectable sex differences in gene
              expression and phenotypic traits. Here we describe a systematic
              survey of XCI, integrating over 5,500 transcriptomes from 449
              individuals spanning 29 tissues from GTEx (v6p release) and 940
              single-cell transcriptomes, combined with genomic sequence data.
              We show that XCI at 683 X-chromosomal genes is generally uniform
              across human tissues, but identify examples of heterogeneity
              between tissues, individuals and cells. We show that incomplete
              XCI affects at least 23\% of X-chromosomal genes, identify seven
              genes that escape XCI with support from multiple lines of
              evidence and demonstrate that escape from XCI results in sex
              biases in gene expression, establishing incomplete XCI as a
              mechanism that is likely to introduce phenotypic diversity.
              Overall, this updated catalogue of XCI across human tissues helps
              to increase our understanding of the extent and impact of the
              incompleteness in the maintenance of XCI.",

  abstract = "Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a conserved
              post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by ADAR enzymes that
              diversifies the transcriptome by altering selected nucleotides in
              RNA molecules. Although many editing sites have recently been
              discovered, the extent to which most sites are edited and how the
              editing is regulated in different biological contexts are not
              fully understood. Here we report dynamic spatiotemporal patterns
              and new regulators of RNA editing, discovered through an
              extensive profiling of A-to-I RNA editing in 8,551 human samples
              (representing 53 body sites from 552 individuals) from the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and in hundreds of
              other primate and mouse samples. We show that editing levels in
              non-repetitive coding regions vary more between tissues than
              editing levels in repetitive regions. Globally, ADAR1 is the
              primary editor of repetitive sites and ADAR2 is the primary
              editor of non-repetitive coding sites, whereas the catalytically
              inactive ADAR3 predominantly acts as an inhibitor of editing.
              Cross-species analysis of RNA editing in several tissues revealed
              that species, rather than tissue type, is the primary determinant
              of editing levels, suggesting stronger cis-directed regulation of
              RNA editing for most sites, although the small set of conserved
              coding sites is under stronger trans-regulation. In addition, we
              curated an extensive set of ADAR1 and ADAR2 targets and showed
              that many editing sites display distinct tissue-specific
              regulation by the ADAR enzymes in vivo. Further analysis of the
              GTEx data revealed several potential regulators of editing, such
              as AIMP2, which reduces editing in muscles by enhancing the
              degradation of the ADAR proteins. Collectively, our work provides
              insights into the complex cis- and trans-regulation of A-to-I

              unique to each of a diverse set of tissues. We used the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6 RNA sequencing data
              across 50 tissues and 449 individuals. First, we developed a
              framework called Transcriptome-Wide Networks (TWNs) for combining
              total expression and relative isoform levels into a single sparse
              network, capturing the interplay between the regulation of
              splicing and transcription. We built TWNs for 16 tissues and
              found that hubs in these networks were strongly enriched for
              splicing and RNA binding genes, demonstrating their utility in
              unraveling regulation of splicing in the human transcriptome.
              Next, we used a Bayesian biclustering model that identifies
              network edges unique to a single tissue to reconstruct
              Tissue-Specific Networks (TSNs) for 26 distinct tissues and 10

              supporting the estimated network structures and identifying 20
              genetic variants with distant regulatory impact on transcription

              for identifying rare variants. Efforts to distinguish pathogenic
              variants from benign rare variants have leveraged the genetic

              with extreme gene expression in studies using single tissues, but
              their effects across tissues are unknown. Here we identify gene
              expression outliers, or individuals showing extreme expression

              present in inflamed salivary gland tissue, within or in close
              proximity to ductal epithelium. FcRL4 is also expressed by nearly
              all pSS-related mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B cell
              lymphomas, linking FcRL4 expression to lymphomagenesis. Whether
              glandular FcRL4+ B cells are pathogenic, how these cells
              originate, and how they functionally differ from FcRL4- B cells
              in pSS is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the phenotype
              and function of FcRL4+ B cells in the periphery and parotid gland
              tissue of patients with pSS. First, circulating FcRL4+ B cells
              from 44 pSS and 54 non-SS-sicca patients were analyzed by flow
              cytometry. Additionally, RNA sequencing of FcRL4+ B cells sorted
              from parotid gland cell suspensions of 6 pSS patients was
              performed. B cells were sorted from cell suspensions as mini bulk
              (5 cells/well) based on the following definitions:
              CD19+CD27-FcRL4- ('naive'), CD19+CD27+FcRL4- ('memory'), and
              CD19+FcRL4+ B cells. We found that, although FcRL4+ B cells were
              not enriched in blood in pSS compared with non-SS sicca patients,
              these cells generally exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype.
              Genes coding for CD11c (ITGAX), T-bet (TBX21), TACI (TNFRSF13B),
              Src tyrosine kinases and NF-$\kappa$B pathway-related genes were,
              among others, significantly upregulated in glandular FcRL4+ B
              cells versus FcRL4- B cells. Pathway analysis showed upregulation
              of B cell activation, cell cycle and metabolic pathways. Thus,
              FcRL4+ B cells in pSS exhibit many characteristics of chronically
              activated, pro-inflammatory B cells and their gene expression
              profile suggests increased risk of lymphomagenesis. We postulate
              that these cells contribute significantly to the epithelial
              damage seen in the glandular tissue and that FcRL4+ B cells are
              an important treatment target in pSS.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Bioinformatic analysis of single-cell gene expression
              data is a rapidly evolving field. Hundreds of bespoke methods
              have been developed in the past few years to deal with various
              aspects of single-cell analysis and consensus on the most
              appropriate methods to use under different settings is still
              emerging. Benchmarking the many methods is therefore of critical
              importance and since analysis of single-cell data usually
              involves multi-step pipelines, effective evaluation of pipelines
              involving different combinations of methods is required. Current
              benchmarks of single-cell methods are mostly implemented with
              ad-hoc code that is often difficult to reproduce or extend, and
              exhaustive manual coding of many combinations is infeasible in
              most instances. Therefore, new software is needed to manage
              pipeline benchmarking. RESULTS: The CellBench R software
              facilitates method comparisons in either a task-centric or
              combinatorial way to allow pipelines of methods to be evaluated
              in an effective manner. CellBench automatically runs combinations
              of methods, provides facilities for measuring running time and
              delivers output in tabular form which is highly compatible with
              tidyverse R packages for summary and visualization. Our software
              has enabled comprehensive benchmarking of single-cell RNA-seq
              normalization, imputation, clustering, trajectory analysis and
              data integration methods using various performance metrics
              obtained from data with available ground truth. CellBench is also
              amenable to benchmarking other bioinformatics analysis tasks.

              Coordinate responsiveness of ILC3s in the intestine depended on

              hamstring exercises, and to investigate whether the measure can
              detect between-leg differences in male participants with and
              without history of unilateral HSI. Methods Twenty male
              participants without and 10 male participants with previous
              unilateral HSI participated. Isometric knee flexor strength and
              peak rate of force development (RFD) at 0°/0°, 45°/45°, and
              90°/90° of hip/knee flexion were measured, as well as force
              impulse during bilateral and unilateral variations of an
              eccentric slider and hamstring bridge, using a novel apparatus.
              Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error, and
              typical error as a coefficient of variation were calculated for
              all measures. The magnitudes of between-leg differences within
              each group were calculated using estimates of effect sizes,
              reported as Cohen's d and 90\% confidence interval (CI). Results
              Moderate to high test-retest reliability was observed for
              isometric knee flexor strength (ICC = 0.87-0.92) and peak RFD
              (ICC = 0.88-0.95) across 3 positions and for mean force impulse
              during the eccentric slider (ICC = 0.83-0.90). In those with
              prior HSI, large deficits were observed in the previously injured
              leg compared to the contralateral uninjured leg for mean force
              impulse during the unilateral eccentric slider (d = -1.09; 90\%
              CI: -0.20, -1.97), isometric strength at 0°/0° (d = -1.06; 90\%
              CI: -0.18, -1.93) and 45°/45° (d = -0.88; 90\% CI: -0.02, -1.74),
              and peak RFD at 45°/45° (d = -0.88; 90\% CI: -0.02, -1.74).
              Conclusion The novel apparatus provides a reliable measure of
              isometric knee flexor strength, peak RFD, and force impulse
              during an eccentric slider, with deficits seen in previously
              injured hamstrings for these measures. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther

  abstract = "STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND:
              Conventional guidelines recommend hamstring strain injury (HSI)
              rehabilitation should only be performed and progressed in
              complete absence of pain, despite lack of comparison to
              alternative approaches. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study
              was to compare the number of days from acute HSI to return to
              play (RTP) clearance following a standardised rehabilitation
              protocol performed within either pain-free or pain-threshold
              limits. The secondary aims were to compare isometric knee flexor
              strength, biceps femoris long head (BFlh) fascicle length, fear
              of movement and re-injury during a six-month follow-up between
              pain-free and pain-threshold groups. METHODS: Forty-three men
              with acute HSIs were randomly allocated to either a pain-free
              (n=22) or pain-threshold (n=21) rehabilitation group. Days from
              HSI to RTP clearance, isometric knee flexor strength, BFlh
              fascicle length, fear of movement and re-injuries within
              six-month follow-up were reported. RESULTS: The median time from
              HSI to RTP clearance was 15 days (95\% CI = 13 to 17) in the
              pain-free group and 17 days (95\% CI = 11 to 24) in the
              pain-threshold group, which was not significantly different (p =
              0.37). Recovery of isometric knee flexor strength at 90/90
              degrees of hip/knee flexion was greater in the pain-threshold
              group at RTP clearance by 15\% (95\% CI = 1 to 28) and by 15\%
              (95\% CI = 1 to 29) at two-month follow-up. BFlh fascicles were
              0.91cm (95\% CI = 0.34 to 1.48) longer at two-month follow-up in
              the pain-threshold group. Two re-injuries occurred in both the
              pain-free and pain-threshold group during six-month follow-up.
              CONCLUSION: Pain-threshold rehabilitation did not accelerate RTP
              clearance but did result in greater recovery of isometric knee
              flexor strength and better maintenance of BFlh fascicle length

  abstract = "Coding variants in epigenetic regulators are emerging as causes
              of neurological dysfunction and cancer. However, a comprehensive
              effort to identify disease candidates within the human epigenetic
              machinery (EM) has not been performed; it is unclear whether
              features exist that distinguish between variation-intolerant and
              variation-tolerant EM genes, and between EM genes associated with
              neurological dysfunction versus cancer. Here, we rigorously
              define 295 genes with a direct role in epigenetic regulation
              (writers, erasers, remodelers, readers). Systematic exploration
              of these genes reveals that although individual enzymatic
              functions are always mutually exclusive, readers often also
              exhibit enzymatic activity (dual-function EM genes). We find that
              the majority of EM genes are very intolerant to loss-of-function
              variation, even when compared to the dosage sensitive
              transcription factors, and we identify 102 novel EM disease
              candidates. We show that this variation intolerance is driven by
              the protein domains encoding the epigenetic function, suggesting
              that disease is caused by a perturbed chromatin state. We then
              describe a large subset of EM genes that are coexpressed within
              multiple tissues. This subset is almost exclusively populated by
              extremely variation-intolerant genes and shows enrichment for
              dual-function EM genes. It is also highly enriched for genes
              associated with neurological dysfunction, even when accounting
              for dosage sensitivity, but not for cancer-associated EM genes.
              Finally, we show that regulatory regions near epigenetic
              regulators are genetically important for common neurological
              traits. These findings prioritize novel disease candidate EM
              genes and suggest that this coexpression plays a functional role
              in normal neurological homeostasis.",

              truncating mutations of ALPK3 in three unrelated families;
              therefore, there is strong genetic evidence that ALPK3 mutation
              causes cardiomyopathy. This study aimed to clarify the mutation
              mechanism and investigate the molecular and cellular pathogenesis
              underlying ALPK3-mediated cardiomyopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
              performed detailed clinical and genetic analyses of a
              consanguineous family, identifying a new ALPK3 mutation
              (c.3792G>A, p.W1264X) which undergoes nonsense-mediated decay in
              ex vivo and in vivo tissues. Ultra-structural analysis of
              cardiomyocytes derived from patient-specific and human
              ESC-derived stem cell lines lacking ALPK3 revealed disordered
              sarcomeres and intercalated discs. Multi-electrode array analysis
              and calcium imaging demonstrated an extended field potential

              cardiomyopathy and demonstrates loss of function as the
              underlying genetic mechanism. We show that ALPK3-deficient

              on the mouse inactive X chromosome has been controversial over
              the last 15 years, and the functional role of H3K9 methylation in
              X chromosome inactivation in any species has remained largely
              unexplored. RESULTS: Here we report the first genomic analysis of
              H3K9 di- and tri-methylation on the inactive X: we find they are
              enriched at the intergenic, gene poor regions of the inactive X,
              interspersed between H3K27 tri-methylation domains found in the
              gene dense regions. Although H3K9 methylation is predominantly
              non-genic, we find that depletion of H3K9 methylation via
              depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase Set domain bifurcated 1
              (Setdb1) during the establishment of X inactivation, results in
              failure of silencing for around 150 genes on the inactive X. By
              contrast, we find a very minor role for Setdb1-mediated H3K9
              methylation once X inactivation is fully established. In addition
              to failed gene silencing, we observed a specific failure to
              silence X-linked long-terminal repeat class repetitive elements.
              CONCLUSIONS: Here we have shown that H3K9 methylation clearly
              marks the murine inactive X chromosome. The role of this mark is
              most apparent during the establishment phase of gene silencing,
              with a more muted effect on maintenance of the silent state.
              Based on our data, we hypothesise that Setdb1-mediated H3K9
              methylation plays a role in epigenetic silencing of the inactive
              X via silencing of the repeats, which itself facilitates gene
              silencing through alterations to the conformation of the whole
              inactive X chromosome.",

              reared in controlled environments remains poorly understood.
              Metastable epialleles refer to loci that intrinsically behave in
              this way and a few examples have been described. They display
              differential methylation in association with differential
              expression. For example, inbred mice carrying the agouti viable
              yellow (A (vy) ) allele show a range of coat colours associated
              with different DNA methylation states at the locus. The
              availability of next-generation sequencing, in particular whole
              genome sequencing of bisulphite converted DNA, allows us, for the
              first time, to search for metastable epialleles at base pair
              resolution. RESULTS: Using whole genome bisulphite sequencing of
              DNA from the livers of five mice from the A (vy) colony, we
              searched for sites at which DNA methylation differed among the
              mice. A small number of loci, 356, were detected and we call
              these inter-individual Differentially Methylated Regions, iiDMRs,
              55 of which overlap with endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs).
              Whole genome resequencing of two mice from the colony identified
              very few differences and these did not occur at or near the
              iiDMRs. Further work suggested that the majority of ERV iiDMRs
              are metastable epialleles; the level of methylation was
              maintained in tissue from other germ layers and the level of mRNA
              from the neighbouring gene inversely correlated with methylation
              state. Most iiDMRs that were not overlapping ERV insertions
              occurred at tissue-specific DMRs and it cannot be ruled out that
              these are driven by changes in the ratio of cell types in the
              tissues analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Using the most thorough
              genome-wide profiling technologies for differentially methylated
              regions, we find very few intrinsically epigenetically variable
              regions that we term iiDMRs. The most robust of these are at
              retroviral elements and appear to be metastable epialleles. The
              non-ERV iiDMRs cannot be described as metastable epialleles at
              this stage but provide a novel class of variably methylated
              elements for further study.",

              recently performed a multiple sclerosis (MS) GWAS where a
              substantial component of the cases (24\%) had DNA derived from
              saliva. Genotyping was done on the Illumina genotyping platform
              using the Infinium Hap370CNV DUO microarray. Additionally, we
              genotyped 10 individuals in duplicate using both saliva- and
              blood-derived DNA. The performance of blood- versus
              saliva-derived DNA was compared using genotyping call rate, which
              reflects both the quantity and quality of genotyping per sample
              and the ``GCScore,'' an Illumina genotyping quality score, which
              is a measure of DNA quality. We also compared genotype calls and
              GCScores for the 10 sample pairs. Call rates were assessed for
              each sample individually. For the GWAS samples, we compared data
              according to source of DNA and center of origin. We observed high
              concordance in genotyping quality and quantity between the paired

              showing greater variation between centers of origin. This large

               fascinating insights into complex diseases even from simple,
               single-marker statistical tests. Most of these tests are
               designed for testing of associations between a phenotype and an
               autosomal genotype and are therefore not applicable to X
               chromosome data. Testing for association on the X chromosome
               raises unique challenges that have motivated the development of
               X-specific statistical tests in the literature. However, to date
               there has been no study of these methods under a wide range of
               realistic study designs, allele frequencies and disease models
               to assess the size and power of each test. To address this, we
               have performed an extensive simulation study to investigate the
               effects of the sex ratios in the case and control cohorts, as
               well as the allele frequencies, on the size and power of eight
               test statistics under three different disease models that each
               account for X-inactivation. We show that existing, but
               under-used, methods that make use of both male and female data
               are uniformly more powerful than popular methods that make use
               of only female data. In particular, we show that Clayton's one
               degree of freedom statistic [Clayton, 2008] is robust and
               powerful across a wide range of realistic simulation parameters.
               Our results provide guidance on selecting the most appropriate
               test statistic to analyse X chromosome data from GWAS and show
               that much power can be gained by a more careful analysis of X

               disease is also a common feature in RA and AS patients. Here we
               have studied a new spontaneous mutation that causes severe
               polyarthritis in bone phenotype spontaneous mutation 1 (BPSM1)
               mice. In addition to joint destruction, mutant mice also develop
               aortic root aneurism and aorto-mitral valve disease that can be
               fatal depending on the genetic background. The cause of the
               disease is the spontaneous insertion of a retrotransposon into
               the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the tumor necrosis factor
               (TNF), which triggers its strong overexpression in myeloid
               cells. We found that several members of a family of RNA-binding,
