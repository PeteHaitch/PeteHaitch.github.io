Today marks the release of Bioconductor 3.7 ([official announcement](http://bioconductor.org/news/bioc_3_7_release/)). 
Congratulations to the hundreds of developers who have collectively developed 
more than 1500 software packages, not to mention the annotation, experiment 
data, and workflow packages. 

A huge thank you to the [core team](http://bioconductor.org/about/core-team/) 
for the incredible work they do, especially around release time! 

Much of my recent development work on Bioconductor has been leveraging and 
extending the 
[**DelayedArray**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/DelayedArray/) 
framework developed by Hervé Pagès (Bioconductor Core Team). This framework 
allows array-like data to be stored on-disk rather than in-memory, a huge 
saving when analysing genome-wide data from tens to hundreds and even thousands 
of samples.

In my work on  [**bsseq**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/bsseq/) and 
[**minfi**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/minfi/), I have been 
responsible for re-engineering the internals of these packages to support the 
analysis of the ever-larger datasets generated in studies of DNA methylation. 
This work spurred the development of  
[**DelayedMatrixStats**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/DelayedMatrixStats/), 
a port of the [**matrixStats**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=matrixStats) 
API to work within the _DelayedArray_ framework.

The _DelayedArray_ framework isn't the first to provide on-disk access to 
array-like data. From my perspective, the killer feature is that it provides a 
common array-like API for handling array data **no matter what *backend* is used to store the data**; the data may be stored in-memory as a dense or sparse matrix 
or on-disk in a HDF5 file. As an analogy, you might think, 'a _DelayedArray_ is 
to an _array_ as a _tibble_ is to a _data.frame_'. 

Over the next few weeks I'm going to write several posts about the 
_DelayedArray_ framework and how Bioconductor package developers[^BioC] can 
leverage it to support on-disk datasets. I'm very interested to hear from 
developers and users to learn what questions they would like to see covered in 
these posts, so feel free to ping me on Twitter 
([@PeteHaitch](http://twitter.com/petehaitch)).

[^BioC]: Non-Bioconductor packages can of course use the _DelayedArray_ framework. However, it's development as a Bioconductor package can be a source of friction for non-Bioconductor packages.

Some of the topics I plan to cover include:

- An overview of the _DelayedArray_ framework
- How do I adapt an existing function to support _DelayedArray_ input?

I'll describe the process of transitioning an existing package to support 
the _DelayedArray_ framework, illustrated using the **bsseq** and **minfi**   
packages. I'll highlight how the **DelayedMatrixStats** package can ease this 
transition, as well as point out some 'gotchas' and tips-n-tricks I learnt 
along the way. I'll also touch on how developers can work with _DelayedArray_ 
objects within C++ using the [**beachmat**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/beachmat/) framework.
