A few weeks ago, I returned home to Australia to attend the wedding of two of 
my dearest friends, Kirsty and Kelly. I had the added excitement of helping 
officate their ceremony and could not have been more thrilled. There's was to 
be the first legal same-sex marriage in Tasmania, the southernmost state of 
Australia. Needless to say, it was a bloody incredible day, as recorded in 
several media articles, including [The Advocate](http://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/5153850/the-historic-wedding-of-kelly-and-kirsty/), [PEDESTRIAN.TV](https://www.pedestrian.tv/dating/kirsty-and-kelly-albion/), and [The Mercury (paywalled)](http://www.themercury.com.au/lifestyle/kelly-mackenzie-and-kirsty-albion-say-wedding-in-tasmania-best-day-of-our-lives/news-story/baea7c3453679d478034bb151aaed78f).

But what gift do you get a couple to celebrate such a beautiful and historic 
occasion? I wanted to give them something personal and decided to create an 
artwork to celebrate their marriage. Now, I'm not much chop when it comes to 
pencil and paper or paint and canvas, but I do know R, and so I created some 
wedding aRtwoRk!

I created nine _sentence drawings_ of Kirsty and Kelly's wedding ceremony 
script. In each variation, a line segment is a sentence from the ceremony, with 
length given by the number of words and the coloured by its sentiment. All that 
changes between the nine panels is the angle between adjacent lines.

This technique of sentence drawings was pioneered by 
[Stefanie Posavec](http://www.stefanieposavec.com/writing-without-words/), but 
I was inspired by this great [article](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/halhen/viz-pub/blob/master/sentence-drawings/code.nb.html) 
by [Henrik Lindberg (@helhen)](https://github.com/halhen). 

I'm really happy with how it turned out. More importantly, so are Kirsty and 
Kelly!
