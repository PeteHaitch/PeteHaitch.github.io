I love weddings. Laughter, dancing, sharing stories, and celebrating a couple 
and their future together. 

Until recently, it was shamefully illegal in Australia for some of my friends 
to marry the person they love. Fortunately, this has changed and same-sex 
marriage is now legal.

A couple of weeks ago I was lucky enough return home to Australia to attend the 
wedding of two of my dearest friends, Kirsty and Kelly. I had the added 
privilege of helping officate their ceremony and could not have been more 
thrilled. There's was to be the first legal same-sex marriage in Tasmania, the 
southermost state of Australia. Needless to say, it was a bloody incredible 
day, as shown below in some gratuitous photos and recorded in several media 
articles, including [The Advocate](http://www.theadvocate.com.au/story/5153850/the-historic-wedding-of-kelly-and-kirsty/), [PEDESTRIAN.TV](https://www.pedestrian.tv/dating/kirsty-and-kelly-albion/), and [The Mercury (paywalled)](http://www.themercury.com.au/lifestyle/kelly-mackenzie-and-kirsty-albion-say-wedding-in-tasmania-best-day-of-our-lives/news-story/baea7c3453679d478034bb151aaed78f).

But what gift do you get a couple to celebrate such a beautiful and historic 
occasion? I wanted to give them something personal and decided to create an 
artwork to celebrate their marriage. Now, I'm not much chop when it comes to 
pencil and paper or paint and canvas, but I do know R, and so I created some 
wedding aRtwoRk!

I took the script from Kirsty and Kelly's wedding ceremony and created 9 
variations of a sentence drawing, inspired by this great 
[article](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/halhen/viz-pub/blob/master/sentence-drawings/code.nb.html) 
by [Henrik Lindberg (@helhen)](https://github.com/halhen). In each variation, a 
line segment is a sentence, with length given by the number of words and the 
coloured by its sentiment. All that changes between the 9 panels is the angle 
between adjacent lines.

I'm really happy with how it turned out. More importantly, so were Kirsty and 
Kelly!
