Earlier this year this equation was doing the rounds of the geek community. 
When plotted it supposedly drew the Batman symbol.

Simple, no? See [here](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/54506/is-this-batman-equation-for-real) 
for a thorough discussion of how all the pieces fit together.

It would seem that you have to work pretty hard for Batman to appear in your

The plot comes from Supplementary Figure 11 of [Li, Y., _et al_. (2010). The DNA methylome of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. _PLoS Biology_, _8_(11), e1000533. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1000533](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000533).  
I'll now be keeping an eye out for superheroes in all my plots!
