abstract = "**AIMS**: We identified a novel homozygous truncating mutation in the gene encoding alpha kinase 3 (*ALPK3*) in a family presenting with paediatric cardiomyopathy. A recent study identified biallelic truncating mutations of *ALPK3* in three unrelated families; therefore, there is strong genetic evidence that *ALPK3* mutation causes cardiomyopathy. This study aimed to clarify the mutation mechanism and investigate the molecular and cellular pathogenesis underlying ALPK3-mediated cardiomyopathy.\n\n**METHODS AND RESULTS**: We performed detailed clinical and genetic analyses of a consanguineous family, identifying a new *ALPK3* mutation (c.3792G>A, p.W1264X) which undergoes nonsense-mediated decay in *ex vivo* and *in vivo* tissues. Ultra-structural analysis of cardiomyocytes derived from patient-specific and human ESC-derived stem cell lines lacking ALPK3 revealed disordered sarcomeres and intercalated discs. Multi-electrode array analysis and calcium imaging demonstrated an extended field potential duration and abnormal calcium handling in mutant contractile cultures.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**: This study validates the genetic evidence, suggesting that mutations in *ALPK3* can cause familial cardiomyopathy and demonstrates loss of function as the underlying genetic mechanism. We show that ALPK3-deficient cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cell models recapitulate the ultrastructural and electrophysiological defects observed *in vivo*. Analysis of differentiated contractile cultures identified abnormal calcium handling as a potential feature of cardiomyocytes lacking ALPK3, providing functional insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ALPK3-mediated cardiomyopathy."
