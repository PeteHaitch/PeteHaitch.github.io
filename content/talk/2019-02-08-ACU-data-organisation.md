# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "You've spent months collecting precious research data, now it's time to analyse it. You open up the first spreadsheet, recorded some time last year, and react in horror:\n\n\n\n- What does that yellow highlighting mean?\n\n- What the hell is in column J?\n\n- Is 12/01/18 the 12th of January, 2018 or the 18th of January, 2012?\n\n- Why does this spreadsheet have 10 columns and the next has 15?\n\n- Who wrote this!? (Oh yeah, it was me ...)\n\n\n\nEver had feelings like this? Then this is the talk for you! I'll give practical advice for data organisation, focusing on spreadsheets, that will make your life easier, not just when it comes time to analyse your data but also when doing data entry."
