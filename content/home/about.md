# Biography

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of 
Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University working in the research group of 
[Kasper Hansen](http://www.hansenlab.org/). I develop statistical methods and 
software to summarise and understand genomics data.

This site include my (very) occasional [blog on statistics and genomics](/post), along 
with the usual academic fare of my papers, [presentations](/talk), {{% staticref "cv/Peter_Hickey_CV.pdf" %}}CV (pdf){{% /staticref %}}, software and data.
