# Biography

I enjoy making sense of data and making it easier for others to do the same.

I am currently a senior research officer at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute 
of Medical Research where I lead the bioinformatics analysis for the Single 
Cell Open Research Endeavour (SCORE). With the SCORE team, I collaborate with 
scientists to design and analyse single-cell genomics experiments. I also 
develop statistical methods and software to summarise and understand genomics 
data, made available through [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/).

This site include my (very) occasional [blog](/post), along with the usual 
academic fare of my papers, [presentations](/talk), 
{{% staticref "cv/Peter_Hickey_CV.pdf" %}}CV (pdf){{% /staticref %}}, 
software and data.
